# Optical flow for event camera
A lightweight network to learn event-based optical flow. (ICPR 2020)

# Introduction
In this work, we present a lightweight pyramid network to learn event-based flow in a self-supervised way. We combine the
pyramidal processing and channel attention mechanism into the proposed network, which significantly simplifies network
but reaches the comparable results over state-of-the-arts.
